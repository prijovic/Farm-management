# Farm management
Developed as part of my internship at Lilly021 D.O.O., this is a simple web application for the management of a user's farm and agricultural operations on it.
Backend was developed using .NET Core 6, PostgresSQL, Redis, Docker. Frontend was developed using TypeScript, react.js, Redux and Material UI components.
